## To run the code

Within a terminal, navigate into the `/src` directory, and run the following command to run the main program:

```
$ python main.py
```

This will execute the main program where the user will be prompted to input a 1 or 2 to select which clustering algorithm to run. 

## Project Organization

Data is in the `/data` directory, code is in the `/src` directory. 

## To Do List:
* Implement K-means and spectral clustering step by step to find clusters of genes that exhibit similar espression profiles.
* Validate clustering using an external index
* Choose an internal index and compare the clustering results.

## Deliverables:
* Two clustering algorithms with two functions respectively. *User should be able to input which method to use*
* Report:
  * Flow of implemented algorithms
  * Compare the performance of internal and external indexes
  * Pros and cons of each algorithm, any findings from experiments
